My dot files
============

My customised dot files. 

Installation
------------
Run the following commands to setup the dot files.  All current dot files will be moved into a directory named dotfiles_old.

    $ git clone git@github.com:davidelliott/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles/
    $ sh ./install.sh

The install script creates links from the home directory to the files/folders in the dotfiles directory.
